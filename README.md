# SQL Sales Analysis Project

This project is intended to demonstrate my foundational SQL skills by analyzing a fictional sales dataset across regions, products, and customers. It covers common business use cases such as but not limited to total revenue analysis, customer value segmentation, and month-over-month growth
---

Project Objectives: 

- Calculate total and average sales performance
- Identify best-selling products
- Track monthly order value trends
- Estimate customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Calculate monthly growth using CTEs and window functions

---

Tools used

- SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL-compatible syntax)
- GitHub for version control and sharing
