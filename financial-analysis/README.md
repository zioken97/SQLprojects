# Financial Analysis by Client Profile

This project is about analyzing financial assets ("patrimoni") based on client profiles. It includes three tables: clients, assets, and patrimoni (client assets).

The goal is to find insights like:
- Total asset value per client profile
- Asset allocation by profile and asset type
- Average asset value based on risk level

All queries are written in SQL and tested with sample data.

## Folder Structure

- `schema.sql` – table definitions for clients, assets, and patrimoni
- `queries/` – includes analysis queries
- `sample_data.sql` – optional data for testing (coming soon)

## Skills Used

- SQL joins
- GROUP BY and aggregation
- Simple data modeling
